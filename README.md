# TrainScheduler
## Firebase Assignment

I am currently a student in the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp. After covering the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript we are now completing our week 8 assignment. For this assignment we are tasked with making a train scheduler that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js.

I hope you enjoy checking it out.

### Here's how the site should work:

1. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

2. The app will have these basic specs:
  
  * When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
    
    * Train Name
    
    * Destination 
    
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    
    * Frequency -- in minutes
  
  * This app should calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
  
  * Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
